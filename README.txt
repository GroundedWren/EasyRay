# EasyRay

EasyRay provides a general ray tracing library and a GUI
for scene creation and rendering control. EasyRay was developed
 at the University of Illinois for the Spring 2017 iteration of
CS242: Programming Studio.


# Contents

EasyRay provides a runnable jar file (EasyRay.jar) to launch the
GUI.

The complete source code is available in the src folder. The main
function is located in src/gui/RenderingInterface.java. The folder
src/images contains pre-supplied textures as well as application
images. The src/config folder contains pre-supplied rendering
configurations.

The reports folder contains files for CS242. These include the project
proposal and weekly demonstrations of new features during
development.

The examples folder contains example rendered images with EasyRay.

EasyRay_Manual.pdf details the use of EasyRay.
